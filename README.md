# Senre

An open source analytics tool that Astra uses internally to track our impact. 

Our goals are: 
1) Create a lightweight library that can scale with our organization
2) Provide transparency to our users on what we track (and why)
3) Use these insights to better our resources and to more clearly define our impact within our user's lives.
